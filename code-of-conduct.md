# Code of Conduct

## How do we plan to collaborate?
We will use Git and GitLab for collaboration. We will hold meetings regularly to divide tasks between our team members and to discuss our progress. Upon dividing the tasks between members, we will use the features of GitLab (feature branches, issues, merge requests, etc.) to track our progress and aid us in collaborating. When the given feature or task has been finished by a team member, we’ll have a process of reviewing the code by other team members, for this we’ll use merge requests. These merge requests should be reviewed and approved by a team member other than the one who created it. A merge request needs to be approved before it is merged.

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
We plan to use several features of Git and GitLab as aids. We will use a GitLab structure with feature branches and issues, both of which will help us trace what other teammates are doing and monitor progress. We will also utilise GitLab commit hooks to establish a connection to a Discord channel, resulting in a constant information feed monitoring progress.

We will share advice and progress updates on Discord. We will complement this with regular in-person meetings, to ensure that no vital information is left out. Scheduled meetings will occur twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. Discord will be used as a means of scheduling extra meetings as needed. 
## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
**READMEs** will be used to document and describe the intended usage of code structures. This will be useful as the information will persist and will be available to whoever needs it in the future.
**Comments:** Ensure to add adequate code documentation, especially for those functions that are difficult to understand. Documentation should be concise and easy to read and understand by the rest of the team.
**Wiki pages:** Add and update workflows on the Wiki page on a weekly basis so that the rest of the team can keep up to date with the implementation and progress of other team members. This will ensure that everyone has insight into all areas of the project and how cross-functional sub-teams or individuals are working on different features of the project.
**On-demand meetings:** Knowledge sharing can mostly be achieved through our regular in-person meetings. For special implementations of some new ideas, on-demand meetings can be scheduled to discuss these ideas. This is a great way to keep the entire team up to date on new ideas and the progress made by each team member.

## What is our usual communication plan?
Our communication channel of choice is Discord, where we will share advice and progress updates. We will complement this with regular in-person meetings, to ensure that no vital information is left out. Scheduled meetings will occur twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. Discord will be used as a means of scheduling extra meetings as needed. 

## What measures do we take to reduce the risk of conflicts happening?
We will have a clear labour division and make sure each team member understands his/her role and task. We will set clear deadlines so that everyone understands what needs to be accomplished and when. We strive for open communication to ensure everyone in the group understands each other's ideas.

## How will we solve conflicts?
In the event of conflicts, we will attempt to resolve them through communication and discussion. We will try to understand the conflict from both sides and come up with a solution. If a resolution cannot be achieved, we will vote to make decisions, based on the principle of majority rule and minority compliance. If conflicts arise between team members and cannot be resolved internally through communication, we will seek assistance from the teacher or TA.

## How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and traceability document the use of LLMs?
We plan using LLM to help us with coding and documentation.

**What we allow:**
- Help us with improving the documentation structure
- Provide inspiration for minor coding problems
- Provide inspiration for writing documentation
- Help with comprehending the assigned tasks

**What we forbid:**
- Verbatim copying of large chunks of code
- Verbatim copying of large sections of documentation

**Rationale:** 
We can use LLMs as our study tool to help us improve our study quality. LLMs can help us with analyzing our existing documentation and improve the work result. It can also assist us when coding, providing inspiration for minor coding problems. However, we should not use LLMs to copy large chunks of code or documentation verbatim. This is because it is important to understand the code and documentation we are writing, and verbatim copying would prevent us from that. We find that the current guidelines strike a good balance by allowing us to utilise the benefits of the tools, while not inhibiting our ability to learn and write high quality code. We also avoid the risk of plagiarism by not copying large chunks of code or documentation word for word.

Every code contribution assisted by LLMs will be documented using two methods. The code in question will be preceded by a comment clarifying the usage and its details. It will specify the name of the model that was used, along with the version number. Any additional comments can be added if any further details ought to be specified, for instance how the model was used, if it wrote code or comments or merely was used for inspiration.
The comment will also contain a reference to a markdown file of the full transcript of the conversation, which will be stored in a directory inside the repository. As these transcripts will be committed along with the changes, they will be traceable throughout the lifecycle of the project.
